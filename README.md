## Intro

This is a configuration aimed at maximising productivity when developing with
PHP. I know that there are a lot of "ultimate" vim configurations out there, 
but I believe vim's true strength to be its ability to be customised according 
to one's own needs. Try to use this configuration as a starting in building your 
own "ultimate" configuration.

## Instalation
Instalation is easy, just paste the following commands in the console:
```
cd ~
mv .vimrc .vimrc.bak
mv .vim .vim.bak
git clone https://github.com/motanelu/macvim-configuration.git vim
git clone  https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
ln -s ./vim .vim
ln -s ./vim/vimrc .vimrc
```
Now start `vim` and issue the `:PluginInstall` command. This will install all the plugin via [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim). 
Some plugins require special attention:

### Vimproc
To build [Vimproc](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim), you need to do the following:
```
cd ~/vim/bundle/vimproc
make
```

Enjoy!
